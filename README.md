This is my profile, the aim of this is to showcase my developing skills as a frontend developer, I have linked another web page I have nearly completed.
In my profile  i have opted for a black, whit and gray theme.
I have added a sidebar obtained from [

I have kept my portfolio simple and easy to navigate.
